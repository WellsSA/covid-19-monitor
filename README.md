This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## âš  Warning: Lecture content ahead âš 

This app was developed to help introducing students to React and React Hooks.<br />
So please consider that the following code is supposed to be easily understandable and not necessarily implements the best code structures, paradigms or patterns.<br />

Keep that in mind and enjoy the stay. ðŸ˜„

## About the project

This project is a covid-19 dashboard app to display in a clean way the current amount of confirmed covid-19 global cases, recovered patients and eventual deaths based on the amazing [covid-19 API](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api) made by _mathdroid_. 

### Running the project

First install the project dependencies, running:<br />
`yarn` or `npm install`.

Then you can start the project, running:<br />
`yarn start` or `npm start`.

This way you will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building the project

This project is supposed to be for study purposes only, so you probably shouldn't be interested in building it. By the way, the build command still works if you want to try:
`yarn build` or `npm run build`.

The build version will be placed at the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## That's all, folks

Hope you enjoyed. 

If you have seen this code in one of my lectures, let me know what you thought about it!

All my contacts still on my porftolio [wellsadev.com](https://wellsadev.com) and they should be available right here on GitHub as well. ðŸ˜„
